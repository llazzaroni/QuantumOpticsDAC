# QuantumOpticsDAC

## About
This repository contains software for generating events related to FPGA-based signal generation for quantum optics experiments. The main function, generateEvents, creates a sequence of samples and configurations based on event timings and user-defined parameters for signal generation. This system ensures efficient management of event sampling and data processing in FPGA-driven experimental setups.

## Features
- Event generation based on FPGA-driven signals
- Signal processing with time-dependent sampling
- Flexible event configuration with user-defined parameters
